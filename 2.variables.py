character_name="Mann"
character_age="40"
print("There once was a man named " + character_name +",")
print("He was " + character_age + " years old.")
print("He Liked the name "+ character_name + ",")

##Python allows you to change the variable between the story

character_name="Mann"
character_age="40"
print("There once was a man named " + character_name +",")
print("He was " + character_age + " years old.")

character_name="Krish"
print("He Liked the name "+ character_name + ",")
print("He didnt like being " + character_age +" years.")

## Python only stores new variable assigned 
## Python lets you store number without Qoutation marks "" 
## you can also store whole number and decimel numbers like 4.5, 64332.53423232356 etcc
character_age= 40
print(character_age)
character_age = 50.4
print(character_age)

## Python also lets you create boolean value

character_name="Mann"
character_age="40"

## this is a boolean is_male = False

is_male= False
print("There once was a man named " + character_name +",")
print("He was " + character_age + " years old.")
print("He Liked the name "+ character_name + ",")
print("He didnt like being " + character_age +" years.")
