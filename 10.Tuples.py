# Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
## How to create a tuple()
coordinates = (4,5)

# Tuples are immutable this means that 
# tuples can not be changed or modified

print(coordinates[1])

## tuples doesnt allow you to change value
# coordinates[0] = 10
#     coordinates[0] = 10
#     ~~~~~~~~~~~^^^
# TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment

# Tuple is used to store data that will never change 
# eg of tuple are 
# 1. user details 
# 2. cooridinates
# 3. author names
# 4. brands

## you can create a tuples inside of a list

coordinates = [(4,5),(9,20),(30,4),(89,40)]
